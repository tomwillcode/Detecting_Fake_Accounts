# Detecting Fake Accounts
Today on most major social media platforms, fake accounts impersonating other people are unfortunately far too common. They may be used for fraud or other malicious purposes. In this github repo you can see a POC for a method that can be implemented through cron jobs and batch processing. With this method using unique name identifiers, computer vision, and NLP it is possible to easily detect and remove such impersonating accounts.
